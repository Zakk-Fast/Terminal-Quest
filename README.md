# WIP - AI Text Adventure

Text based adventure game powered by AI, because I miss playing classic text adventures like Zork and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And because sometimes you just have to make something dumb and fun. AI sets the scene and you react. Inventory keeps track of where you've been and what you've collected.

## Done

- Terminal UI with retro green-on-black styling
- Sidebar with inventory and visited locations tracking
- TypeScript types for game state and LLM integration

## Left to do

- Input handling and command submission
- Game state management
- OpenAI integration
- Context refresh system for LLM
- Typewriter effect for responses
- Save/load game state
- Error handling and loading states
